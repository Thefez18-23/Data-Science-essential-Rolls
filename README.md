Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

	1.	Identify Key Skills in Demand: Analyze the top skills required for data analyst positions with a focus on emerging technologies like AI, Python, and machine learning.
	2.	Salary Distribution: Examine the salary distribution for data analyst roles, identifying key salary ranges and the correlation between specific skills and compensation levels.
	3.	Top Job Titles and Companies: Highlight the most common job titles and the top companies hiring data analysts.
	4.	Visualize the Data: Use professional visualizations (bar charts, histograms, and word clouds) to clearly present the findings.
	5.	Actionable Insights: Provide conclusions and recommendations based on the analysis, helping job seekers align their skills with market demands.

Technologies Used

	•	Python 3.x
	•	Pandas – for data manipulation and analysis
	•	Matplotlib – for data visualization
	•	WordCloud – for generating word clouds of key skills
	•	Jupyter Notebook or any IDE (like PyCharm, VSCode)

Data Description

The dataset used in this project includes:

	•	Job Titles: Titles of job listings, primarily focused on data analysts.
	•	Skills: Key skills required for the job roles, including AI, machine learning, Python, SQL, etc.
	•	Salaries: Salary ranges for data analyst roles, which are cleaned and analyzed for patterns.

The data is cleaned to remove any unwanted symbols (like currency symbols) and transformed to ensure numeric consistency for salary analysis.
